Open Data is Public

This repository comprises examples I have collected and modified to support the idea of data visualization, based on the premise that Open Data projects will benefit most from:
+ Data Visualization
+ Data Enrichment
+ Smart Adaptation

These examples use Mike Bostocks d3.js library. Whereas his examples typically use the bl.ocks pastebin, I am storing these to Github and then piping them through jsFiddle, which makes them very easy to fork and tweak.

Contents include:
+ [D3 Quadrant Example](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/d3/3.0.4/phollott/opendata/tree/master/d3quadrant/)
+ [D3 Sunburst Example](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/d3/3.0.4/phollott/opendata/tree/master/d3sunburst/)
+ [D3 Treemap Example](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/d3/3.0.4/phollott/opendata/tree/master/d3treemap/)
