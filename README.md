Open Data is Public

This repository comprises examples I have collected and modified using Mike Bostock's d3.js [Data Driven Documents](http://d3js.org/) library to support data visualization. Whereas his examples use the bl.ocks pastebin, I am storing these to Github and then piping them through jsFiddle, making them very easy to fork and tweak. 

Contents include:
+ [D3 Quadrant Example](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/d3/3.0.4/phollott/opendata/tree/master/d3quadrant/)
+ [D3 Sunburst Example](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/d3/3.0.4/phollott/opendata/tree/master/d3sunburst/)
+ [D3 Treemap Example](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/d3/3.0.4/phollott/opendata/tree/master/d3treemap/)

My premise here is that Open Data projects will benefit most from:
+ Data Visualization
+ Data Enrichment
+ Smart Adaptation

Client-side libraries like D3.js provide superior Data Visualization.
