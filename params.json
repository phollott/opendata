Whereas his examples use the bl.ocks pastebin, I am storing these to Github, routed through jsFiddle, making them easy to fork and tweak. \r\n\r\nContents include:\r\n+ [D3 Quadrant Example](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/d3/3.0.4/phollott/opendata/tree/master/d3quadrant/)\r\n+ [D3 Sunburst Example](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/d3/3.0.4/phollott/opendata/tree/master/d3sunburst/)\r\n+ [D3 Treemap Example](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/d3/3.0.4/phollott/opendata/tree/master/d3treemap/)\r\n\r\nMy premise here is that Open Data projects will benefit most from:\r\n+ Data Visualization\r\n+ Data Enrichment\r\n+ Smart Adaptation\r\n\r\nClient-side libraries like d3.js provide superior Data Visualization.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
