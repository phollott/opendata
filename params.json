{"name":"Opendata","tagline":"Open Data is Public","body":"# opendata\r\nOpen Data is a public repository.\r\n\r\nThis repository comprises examples I have forked and modified using Mike Bostock's [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) (Data Driven Documents) library to support data visualization. Where his examples use the bl.ocks pastebin, I am storing these to GitHub, routed through jsFiddle, to make them easy to fork. \r\n\r\nContents include:\r\n+ [D3 Quadrant Example](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/d3/3.0.4/phollott/opendata/tree/master/d3quadrant/)\r\n+ [D3 Sunburst Example](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/d3/3.0.4/phollott/opendata/tree/master/d3sunburst/)\r\n+ [D3 Treemap Example](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/d3/3.0.4/phollott/opendata/tree/master/d3treemap/)\r\n\r\nMy premise here is that Open Data projects will benefit most from:\r\n+ Data Visualization\r\n+ Data Enrichment\r\n+ Smart Adaptation\r\n\r\nData Visualization\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nClient-side libraries like d3.js provide superior Data Visualization. When access to open data is combined with tools for making these data useful and meaningful, the quality of the data can be improved.\r\n\r\nData Enrichment\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nProjects like the [Yosemite Project](http://yosemitemanifesto.org/) suggest that RDF can be used as a universal language for representation of information. Mapping various information standards into RDF has the benefit of facilitating both standardization and transformation; but there is another benefit of mapping industry-specific information into a more generic format like RDF, as this will allow clinical documents and messages containing lab results or prescriptions to non-clinical assets, like product brochures and other ancillary services.\r\n\r\nSmart Adaptation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n*Smart adaptation* is a term I have started using to refer to any adaptation into a JSON format, especially when the JSON format is Atom-based. I am borrowing the idea of \"JSON Bundles\" from HL7 FHIR, but essentially, these are just Atom syndication (similar to RSS), implemented using JSON instead of XML.\r\n\r\n+ [HL7 FHIR JSON Bundles](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/extras.html#bundle)\r\n\r\nSmart adaptation is smart because JSON is more useful on the client-side than XML; but XML, which can be thoroughly validated, is more useful on the server-side. So they both have their charms.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
