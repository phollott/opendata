Whereas his examples use the bl.ocks pastebin, I am storing these to Github, routed through jsFiddle, making them easy to fork and tweak. \r\n\r\nContents include:\r\n+ [D3 Quadrant Example](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/d3/3.0.4/phollott/opendata/tree/master/d3quadrant/)\r\n+ [D3 Sunburst Example](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/d3/3.0.4/phollott/opendata/tree/master/d3sunburst/)\r\n+ [D3 Treemap Example](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/d3/3.0.4/phollott/opendata/tree/master/d3treemap/)\r\n\r\nMy premise here is that Open Data projects will benefit most from:\r\n+ Data Visualization\r\n+ Data Enrichment\r\n+ Smart Adaptation\r\n\r\nClient-side libraries like d3.js provide superior Data Visualization.\r\n\r\nSmart Adaptation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n*Smart adaptation* is a term I have started using to refer to any adaptation into a JSON format, especially when the JSON format is Atom-based. I am borrowing the idea of \"JSON Bundles\" from HL7 FHIR, but essentially, these are just Atom syndication (similar to RSS), implemented using JSON instead of XML.\r\n\r\n+ [HL7 FHIR JSON Bundles](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/extras.html#bundle)\r\n\r\nSmart adaptation is smart because JSON is more useful on the client-side than XML; but XML, which can be thoroughly validated, is more useful on the server-side. So they both have their charms.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
